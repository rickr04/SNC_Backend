Look at the SAQA and find all the relevant SAQ questions on the spreadsheet. 
For SAQA these should all be a part of requirement 9 and requirement 12.

*Note* some questions will have a part (a) and (b), add this to the end of the ID

In the spreadsheet create 2 new columns to the right, one will be ID, the other will be questiontype.
From here you need to fill the spreadsheet out with the relevant ID and question type for each question.
For now let's set the ID to the requirement number. 
The question type is the following 
0: Written answer,
1: Multiple choice answer,
2: No answer

From what I've gleamed all the questions for SAQA are MC with responses Yes, Yes with CCW, No, and N/A

Once you have all the spreadsheet filled out you just need to create an array of JSON objects for the questions in script.js

Here's an example for the first two questions:

let questions = [
    {
        "questiontext":"Are all media physically secured (including but not limited to computers, removable electronic media, paper receipts, paper reports, and faxes)?",
        "answertype":1,
        "answers":["Yes", "Yes with CCW", "No", "N/A"],
        "_id":"9.5"
    },
    {
        "questiontext":"Is strict control maintained over the internal or external distribution of any kind of media?",
        "answertype":1,
        "answers":["Yes", "Yes with CCW", "No", "N/A"],
        "_id":"9.6.a"
    },...
]

Once this is finished we'll need to create the SAQ type and edit the PDF appropriately.
