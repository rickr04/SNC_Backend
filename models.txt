Current Schemas for backend models (Mainly used to help me build the front end models.)

Users:

SuperUser (This most likely should be renamed to just User, but would mean editing a lot of code) {
  email: String,
  password: String,
  fname: String,
  lname: String,
  address: String,
  company: String,
  telephone: String,
  issuper: Boolean (True if Super, False if Sub),
  superuser: ObjectId referencing another SuperUser (Only relevant for SubUsers),
  subusers: Array of ObjectIds referencing SubUser (Only relevant for SuperUsers),
  saqtemplates: Array of Strings referencing SAQTemplate (Only relevant for SubUsers)
  businessinfo: Object containing info that is relevant to the business and used to fill out SAQs (Only relevant for SuperUsers)
}

SAQ Stuff:

Question {
  questiontext: String,
  answertype: Number (0 for free-response, 1 for MC, 2 for free-response),
  answers: [String] (Only relevant for answertype 1, represents the multiple choice options),
  _id: Manually set ID to help us better track questions (This one is a string while every other ID is an ObjectId)
}

SAQTemplate {
  _id: Manually set string ID.
  questions: Array of ID strings referencing questions
}

AccountSAQ {
  superuserid: ObjectId referencing superuserid
  name: String,
  questionsandanswers: JSON object,
  templateid: String ID referencing SAQ template
}

AnsweredQuestion {
  question: String ID referencing Question,
  answer: String,
  superuserid: ObjectId referencing supersers
  ccw: Array of JSON objects relevant to questions answered "Yes with CCW"
}
